I got the two datasets from http://www.oxxostudio.tw/articles/201803/google-maps-15-geojson-taiwan.html

In the webpage, the data are from:
https://sheethub.com/
  https://sheethub.com/ronnywang/100年全國縣市界圖
https://github.com/g0v/twgeojson




Currently in the counties folder, I use the coarse_TWcounties_geojson file to create geojson file for each county/city.

Also, there are two other files in the folder. One is a list of the names of the counties/cities, the other is a list of lon,lat of the center of the counties.

The lon,lat pairs are done (poorly) using get_county_center_lonlat.py. So manual modification is needed later.



These raw data are in the original_files folder
